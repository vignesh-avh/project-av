# AV — Availability & Visibility

AV is a mobile platform that helps business owners get visibility for their products
and helps customers see what is available before they go looking for it.

This is not a delivery app.

## What AV does
- Business owners list and manage their product availability
- Customers can discover products and where they are available
- Direct visibility without forcing delivery or heavy commissions

## Tech Stack
- Android App: Kotlin + Jetpack Compose
- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Database: MongoDB

## Current State
- Android app foundation is built (80% done)
- Backend APIs are in place (80% done)
- Core flows exist and are working (80% done)
- Development reached a point where moving alone will slow things down

AI tools were used to speed up development where useful,
but the codebase and architecture are understood and maintained by me.

## Looking For (Co-Builders)
I’m looking for people who want to **build**, not freelance.

### 1. Android Developer
- Kotlin + Jetpack Compose
- Comfortable working with an existing codebase
- Interested in product quality and long-term ownership

### 2. Backend Developer
- Python / FastAPI
- API design, auth, and system thinking
- Interested in building something that can scale properly

### 3. Marketing & Growth Partner
- Strategy + execution
- Focus on real adoption, not just ads or vanity metrics

## How this works
- No salary at the moment (bootstrapped)
- Long-term equity partnership
- Clear discussion before any serious commitment
- Trial collaboration before calling anything “official”
